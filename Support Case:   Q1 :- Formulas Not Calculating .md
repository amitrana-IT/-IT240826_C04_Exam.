 To troubleshoot a problem of formulas not calculating in Excel,
 specific information needs to be elicited from the user. 
 Such questions will narrow down whether it is particular cells or if it is the whole spreadsheet that has problems. 
 Knowing the cell formatting and the calculation setting can better isolate the problem.
